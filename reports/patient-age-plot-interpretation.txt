The following markers have been excluded from plotting because they have two or fewer points per patient: VEGF, G.CSF, EGF, HGF, FGF.Basic, IFNa, IFNg, TNFa. 

The following markers should probably be excluded from analysis because the data are absent or below measurement thresholds for at least 2 of the 3 patients: Eotaxin, GM.CSF, IFN.g, IL.2, IL.2R, IL.5, IL.6, IL.7, IL.10 (this one borderline), IL.12, IL.13, IL.15, IL.17, IP.10, MIP.1a, MIP.1b, RANTES, TNF.a, 

The remaining markers are IL.1b, IL.1RA, IL.4, MCP.1, MIG, IFN.a, IL.8  

For IL.1b, two (132, 204) out of the three patients with both before and after NTM detection samples show a sharp increase after infection. The patients are disease negative and positive, respectively. 

For IL.1RA, one patient (132, disease not present) shows a drop in the marker around the time of infection, with recovery to preinfection levels within one year. The patient with disease has a markedly higher value than disease negative patients throughout the compared course of time. 

For IL.4, the patient with the disease (204) shows a drop in marker level at the time of infection. One patient without disease shows no change (132) and the other's levels are below threshold. 

For MCP.1, 2 patients show a drop in levels at the time of infection (204 and 491, disease present and absent respectively).

For MIG, all patients show a long term decrease in marker levels, but there is no apparent relationship with time of infection. 

For IFN.a, patients 132 and 204 (disease negative and positive, respectively), show a drop in levels immediately preceeding infection. 

For IL.8, 2 patients show a drop in levels at the time of infection (204 and 491, disease present and absent respectively).
